LaTeX Files 
=========== 

Collection of LaTeX templates and source code that I've used for personal
documents such as handouts and notes. 

My main LaTeX style file is called `muwasifk.sty` and is found in the home
directory. In order to use it, place it into the same directory as your main 
tex file and add

    \includepackage{muwasifk} 

to your main preamble.
